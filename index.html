			<p>Since early 2021, I’ve worked at Mercury as a Senior Product Designer. I’m designing the iOS and Android apps. On the side, I’m focused on Mercury's design outreach and design team culture.</p>
			<p>From 2020 to 2021, I worked at ODX as a Product Designer under the leadership of Gabby Manotoc. I built out a white-labeled design system that allowed our product to be personalized for various clients such as PNC, UBS, and Huntington Bank. ODX merged with Fundation to create Linear Financial Technologies – I worked alongside Lauren Gallagher and Gabby Manotoc to create the brand identity. Linear has since been acquired by Amount.</p>
			<p>A couple years before Mercury and ODX, I worked as a UX Design Intern at Limeade.</p>
