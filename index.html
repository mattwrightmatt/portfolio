	<p>Matt Wright</p>
	<p>Since early 2021, Iâ€™ve worked at Mercury as a Senior Product Designer. Iâ€™m leading design for the iOS and Android apps. On the side, Iâ€™m focused on design outreach, the Meridian magazine, and design team culture
From 2020 to 2021, I worked at ODX as a Product Designer under the leadership of Gabby Manotoc. I built out a white-labeled design system that allowed our product to be personalized for various clients such as PNC, UBS, and Huntington Bank. ODX merged with Fundation to create Linear Financial Technologies â€“Â I worked alongside Lauren Gallagher and Gabby Manotoc to create the brand identity. Linear has since been acquired by Amount.
Years prior to Mercury and ODX, I worked as a UX Design Intern at Limeade.</p>
