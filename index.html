			<p>Product Design</p>
			<p>Since early 2021, I’ve worked at Mercury as a Senior Product Designer. I’m leading design for the iOS and Android apps. On the side, I’m focused on design outreach and design team culture</p>
			<p>From 2020 to 2021, I worked at ODX as a Product Designer under the leadership of Gabby Manotoc. I built out a white-labeled design system that allowed our product to be personalized for various clients such as PNC, UBS, and Huntington Bank. ODX merged with Fundation to create Linear Financial Technologies – I worked alongside Lauren Gallagher and Gabby Manotoc to create the brand identity. Linear has since been acquired by Amount.</p>
			<p>Years prior to Mercury and ODX, I worked as a UX Design Intern at Limeade.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Freelance Practice</p>
			<p>On the side, I maintain a freelance practice called Internet Design Company. I partner with tech companies, design studios, and individuals. My practice specializes in Web and App Design, Design Audits, Design Systems, Digital Brand Design, and Product Strategy.</p>
			<p>I’ve worked with various clients such as Pfizer, ADP, Deloitte, Barstool Sports, BibleProject, and Kalpa.</p>
			<p>In May of 2022, I worked with a former colleague to create wireframes to launch the MVP of a product called Kalpa – a clinical trial software that streamlines collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, providers, and administrators.</p>
			<p>In October of 2021, I partnered with Malka Media to create a microsite for ADP. The microsite was a interactive questionaire designed for c-level executives who could benefit from learning about the numerous ways their business could be disrupted.</p>
			<p>From early to mid 2021, I partnered with Fivestone in an Art Direction and Design capacity to build out a design system for BibleProject. After establishing an art direction and a color and type system, I oversaw a handful of designers who carried the system to completion.</p>
