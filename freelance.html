			<p>On the side, I maintain a freelance practice called Internet Design Company. I partner with tech companies, design studios, and individuals. My practice specializes in Web and App Design, Design Audits, Design Systems, Digital Brand Design, and Product Strategy.</p>
			<p>I’ve worked with various clients such as Pfizer, ADP, Deloitte, Barstool Sports, BibleProject, and Kalpa.</p>
			<p>In May of 2022, I worked with a former colleague to create wireframes to launch the MVP of a product called Kalpa – a clinical trial software that streamlines collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, providers, and administrators.</p>
			<p>In October of 2021, I partnered with Malka Media to create a microsite for ADP. The microsite was an interactive questionnaire designed for c-suite executives who could benefit from learning about the numerous ways their business could be disrupted.</p>
			<p>From early to mid 2021, I partnered with Fivestone in an Art Direction and Design capacity to build out a design system for BibleProject. After establishing an art direction and a color and type system, I oversaw a handful of designers who carried the system to completion.</p>
			<p>In July 2020, I partnered with Malka Media to design a landing page for a Barstool Sports sports betting app.</p>
			<p>In June 2020, I partnered with Malka Media on a quick turnaround projet to design a microsite for attendees of the Deloitte Best Managed Companies conference.</p>
			<p>In February 2020, I partnered with Malka Media to design an ADP Evolution of Pay microsite that visualized complex payment method data across different regions and age groups around the world.</p>
			<p>For the first few months of 2020, I partnered with Malka Media to design an educational microsite to demo the Next Gen HCM app. The microsite design provided a framework that inspired the design for ADP demos across multiple departments.</p>
